# Artoo Strategy

Artoo is at an exciting place. We are making 6 Crs of revenue and have differentiated ourselves. While the market is here, we feel the next wave is starting. Like round 1, we need to out think our competitors in all possible dimensions. 

Look through the current product of Artoo:

1) Mobile from demo.demo.artoo.in (ask for a pre-installed version from Artoo)
   * Application -- Kathirvel N, Rajesh Singh

2) Web 
   * http://efl.demo.artoo.in/branch-manager#/j2vmu3nk/j2vmu3nk-home
   * http://demo.demo.artoo.in/cluster-credit-manager#/j2vmu3nk/apps?context=1000&stage=provisional-approval-ccm
      * Amit Pithava
   * http://demo.demo.artoo.in/admin#/d3pgzadk/org/roles
   
   
Stakeholders of our Product

* Borrower
  * Hetrogeneous customer segment with having absolutely no data (Credit Bureau history, Bank Statements, Collateral) to having some data and being tech savvy. They want to be treated with respect and have big aspirations for themselves. They want a quick and easy process with transparency of whether they are getting a loan at every stage or not.

* User (Field Agent / Feet on street, Credit Approver)
  * Simple 10-12th guy. Well trained in the process to giving out a loan.
  * Works 8 hours on the ground, roaming around in the field. Has high targets. His Branch Manager expects the world from him but doesn't give specific instructions on how to improve. He wants those incentives but seems to be doing only 50-60% a month
  * Excited to serve customers. See's the opportunity to help them out of poverty or be a part of their dreams.
  * Worried that he will be left behind in the new IT / Tech economy. Wants to prove to his family that he can do well.

* Lender (Bank or MFI)
  * Generally averse to this segment. Too expensive. Too high-touch. Too risky
  * Realizes that their traditional approach doesn't work. Need a partner like Artoo to help them develop product, policy and process. But find it hard to commit to that. Needs evidence, back-testing of policy etc

### A recent tweet that makes a lot sense:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The only three things worth doing at a startup:<br>-Make the product better<br>-Sell the product better<br>-Create leverage for either of first two</p>&mdash; Sam Gerstenzang (@gerstenzang) <a href="https://twitter.com/gerstenzang/status/919713909292052482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

### Task

Do a short 2-3 page spec for an improvement(s) on Mobile and Web that you would make to that product that addresses all three stakeholders and makes Artoo competitive. Your spec should be written in short paragraphs and bullet points. Include block diagram level architecture details, and UX screenshots, Wireframes and diagrams.

We recommend that you follow the outline below, or something similar:
1. Background
2. Problem Statement
3. Current Solution
4. Proposed Solution
5. Assumptions
6. User Stories
 a. Use Cases
 b. Requirements
 
As guidance on the scope: if your spec were to be implemented, it should take 2-3 devs no longer than 1-2 weeks to ship it. You should be able to complete this assignment in less than 5 hours. We are looking for concise communication and clarity of thought end-to-end.

Rubric of evaluation:
1) How much you understand about the domain by looking at these products
2) How do you go about prioritizing missing features.
3) How do you design features
